It does get extremely busy, so the crowds might not be for everyone. But the main attraction is the sunset. The view from Mindil Beach is pretty special; The sun looks bigger here as it sets right over the Arafura sea and you get that uninterrupted horizon. It’s one of those sunsets that really stops you in your tracks. Everyone claps when it is over because it is spectacular! There’s a great mix of street food stalls, local arts and crafts, and live music. I even saw people doing camel rides along the beach as the sun was coming down. Something to note – you can’t bring dogs into the market area, unless it’s a certified assistance dog. It’s a bit of a shame if you’re travelling with your pet, but good to know before you go.

This is unacceptable given that customers are paying full retail prices and reasonably expect fresh, safe-to-consume products. In addition, while product prices continue to rise — often with little to no notice beyond a simple price tag change — there seems to be no corresponding improvement in quality, service, or customer experience. This raises questions about the company’s priorities and commitment to value. I urge Woolworths to address these ongoing quality and operational issues with urgency. Customers deserve better — we are not asking for free goods; we are simply asking for fair value and consistent standards. I hope this feedback is taken seriously and acted upon in the interest of all shoppers.",1.0,2025-04-17T17:17:09+00:00,https://maps.google.com/?cid=8127742133251979638,Prabin Dahal,"{""place_id"": ""ChIJO8qr1wuRwCwRdrl1VmiKy3A"", ""reviews_sort"": ""most_relevant""}",0,0,,,,google,1219,184,11,ChIJO8qr1wuRwCwRdrl1VmiKy3A,2025-04-17 17:17:09,2025.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,0,0,1.0,neg,,

It is expansive, so you will get an excellent workout as it is set on a hilly slope - find a layout map if you want to get through it all. Notable section is the Madagascar & African garden with massive Baob trees incl the local native Adansonia Gregorii. Waterfall has not worked for quite awhile & it is evident parts of the garden is neglected. Interesting tropical trees like Ashoka Seraca (religious significance to Buddhists), toxic Suicide Tree (Cerberus Odallam) - up there with Death Cap mushies 🫣, Pride of Burma Amhertsia, Black Bean Moreton chestnut tree, Sausage Tree (er.. rr..true - from Africa) & quite few others used in perfumes, medicinal oils or just plain quirky. Main entrance is actually across the road from Mindil Sunset Beach area - look for Eva's Cafe on google which is just past entrance. Interesting sculptures scattered around, some good & others like the dinosaurs in the cycad area plain garish (cast off from elsewhere). The Centre is worth a visit for background & seed saving history. We spotted a Rufuos Owl & you will see & hear the ubiquitous native scrubfowls.

There’s a great mix of stalls offering food from all over Southeast Asia, fresh produce, handmade goods, flowers, and local art. My absolute go to is the Popia; the spring rolls here are the best!! I also always get the Vietnamese pork skewers and paw paw salad—so yummy:) The smoothie and juice stalls are beautiful too; perfect for something cool and refreshing when it's starting to warm up. It does get busy, but parking is usually okay if you arrive early or don’t mind walking a little. Dogs aren’t allowed in the market area, which is a shame if you’re bringing your pup along—but good to know ahead of time.

Unfortunately, swimming isn’t always allowed depending on the season , but when it’s open, the natural pools and small waterfalls are just magical . During the wet season, it’s usually very quiet, which makes it even more peaceful and a great escape from the crowds ️. Whether you’re here for a picnic, a quiet walk, or (when safe) a refreshing swim, this place really showcases the beauty of the NT.

You can relax in any of them, though the lower pools tend to be more popular. The water is deep in parts, which makes it ideal for floating with a pool noodle or even jumping in from the rock ledges.

Recounts not only the origins of the crucial medical & allied health services Australia's Flying Doctors Services provide to the remote & inaccessible outback regions but also the WW2 Bombing of Darwin from a different perspective. After half day tour of Darwin's WW2 bombarment the day prior, I should have been fatigued by overload of info on this subject matter but not! The VR & holographic presentations are brief & totally ""eye witness"" immersive experience not to be missed. Excellent & moving tribute to essential services RFDS provides to health & mental well-being of remote communities. The origin of this service by Rev. John Flynn & others who contributed is illuminating as is the association with Quensland & NT Aerial Services (Qantas). The VR that showcases this section is in 2 parts: one takes you soaring over the red centre of this continent with pilot's narrative. 2nd: you are in the plane in an emergency situation with a real patient (not confronting). A sensory appreciation for the services & skills of highly trained nurse & navigating pilot. Explore the interior of an actual RFDS plane. Facilty staff are very welcoming & helpful with suggestions on how best to utilise your 1.5 to 2 hours here. A free courtesy shuttle bus operates to pick up & drop off in front of facilty from 11.30 am onwards every 15 mins (check the post outside for times & locations). Operates only from upper areas to this lower Wharf facility which is quite an uphill climb to return.

Check-in was efficient and friendly. The snack pack (a muffin, a biscuit, a mandarin and water bottle) was exactly what was needed to keep us sustained until lunchtime. The crew were outstanding. The commentary by our principal guide, Landon, provided a wealth of information about the geological history of the gorge, the first nations peoples' Dreaming narrative, historical events during the era of Western exploration, and current management of the ecosystem. He was very engaged and fun to listen to. The views all the way along the gorges were breathtaking. The occasional sighting of a freshie (freshwater crocodile) resting on the bank or on a rock added to the experience. The chance to have a swim in a waterhole, separated from the main gorge and fed by a waterfall, was an absolute treat. We're so glad we did it.

It’s a more laid-back market compared to some of the busier ones around Darwin, but still has a great atmosphere. I had the most amazing fresh paw paw salad made right in front of me, and the mango juice with orange, ginger and honey was next level—so refreshing! Easily one of the best juices I’ve had:) Something to note—dogs aren’t allowed at the markets, which is the same across most of the markets in Darwin. It’s a bit of a shame if you're travelling with your dog, but worth knowing before you go. Parking can be a bit tight, but there’s usually some available around the shopping centre or nearby streets.

Watch the cutesy flitting of the pink crested Jacana & his little ones on the lilly pads, blue kingfisher darting in & out of the water, Darters drying their wings, tons of whistling ducks, elegant Jabirus, multitude of herons & some birds of prey flying overhead.

We reached the reception desk at 5:03 PM precisely, only to be met with immediate hostility from the woman in charge. Before we could even explain our situation, she shouted at us that the reception was closed. We calmly tried to explain that we were in an emergency situation, hoping for a shred of understanding or assistance. Instead, we were met with a complete refusal to even consider a solution. There was no discussion, no flexibility, and certainly no compassion. Working in the tourism and hospitality industry requires a fundamental appreciation for human contact and a capacity for empathy. The individual we encountered possessed neither. Her behaviour was not just unprofessional; it was deeply unkind. One has to wonder about the kind of life that leads to such a cold and dismissive attitude towards people in need. I genuinely suggest she reconsiders her career path, as she is clearly unsuited for any role that requires customer service.

Pool noodles are highly recommended, even for confident swimmers, to help float and fully enjoy the experience. There’s a short walking trail nearby through a forested area, where we spotted bats sleeping upside down in the trees — some still awake and making quite a bit of noise, which added to the atmosphere. For those not planning to swim, there’s also a fantastic viewing platform overlooking the falls. The amenities here are excellent — the cafe (though closed when we arrived mid-afternoon) and the modern, clean toilets and change rooms were better than most other stops in the park.

google_maps,Woolworths Casuarina,"Normally I don’t like doing a review for anything because I do business and been working for many jobs as a customer service. Also I used to work for Woolworth before. On Wednesday the 4th June 2025. I finished work late and took my mum out for shopping at Casuarina Woolies at 7:30pm. I understand that is less front staff and more to nightfill and grocery staff working. We got ready to check out with small trolly pretty much small and big stuffs. But there are non service open, only small desk serve and self service. So I have experience I decided to go for the self service. As you know Woolies have small space for putting scanned item on the side and is not allow if the item doesn’t put on side after you scanned and the machine is stuck for assistant. So I asked one lady to help me with the quantity so is easier and faster, but she standing doesn’t want to help and ask me to scan one by one. Then I told her to I couldn’t cause is full on the side. So I have 12 pack mince beef and she’s play a game count twice and twice, so I said come on I’m rushing home I don’t have time to wait for you counting just 12 pack beef, but rest of all item I did scanned myself. She gave me that face and told me you should come early and do your shopping. And smash damage my item on the side and my mum was so mad and argue that we not gonna pay $300 for the shopping that she’s doing like a rubbish. And she’s pointing at me that I am rude to her that I asked her to help with quantity that she doesn’t want to help at that time. She said I was rude to ask her to rush. Oh well if I ask the customer service staff to count twice and twice for just 12 pack beef would anyone wait for her? And I have repeated to her and is only 12 pack on the trolly nothing else. One thing I know for customer service. If you don’t want to work and you’re tired from the long day. Don’t put your mood on someone who didn’t do anything wrong to you. And if you cannot handle this PLEASE STAY HOME and relax how you like. I have right to go shopping whenever is still open. If I can scanned without needing permission from assistance I don’t want to ask anyone of those shit staff to help me.

Everytime I purchase a monster from Woolworth’s I find it’s flat or tastes off somehow, but Cole’s tastes fresh and as it should? It’s the same products so there shouldn’t be a difference correct? Just today I bought a pack of burger rings from Woolworth’s and hadn’t realised that I already bought one from Cole’s earlier in the week. Opened the Woolworth’s ones, tasted stale and old, so I closed it up and ate the Cole’s ones, fresh and could have been made yesterday from the way they tasted. I understand stock rotation and the fact oldest products go to the front new to the back, but it’s such a consistent decline in quality when comparing Cole’s and Woolworth’s..? I don’t know why this seems to be the case, whether Cole’s staff just choose not to rotate so fresh product goes first, but it’s always better.",1.0,2025-06-29T07:09:01+00:00,https://maps.google.com/?cid=8365768790843613827,Melissa C,"{""place_id"": ""ChIJL1q2nZ-UwCwRg2JIO2QuGXQ"", ""reviews_sort"": ""most_relevant""}",0,0,,,,google,963,171,9,ChIJL1q2nZ-UwCwRg2JIO2QuGXQ,2025-06-29 07:09:01,2025.0,6.0,6.0,16.0,1,0,1.0,neg,,

Everything is good until we reach the self-service checkout. There is a staff lady with no badge name on her uniform, she has black short hair and wearing glasses, who asked me to open my nappy bag and check. I know that is a usual rule at every retail provider. I already opened my nappy bag for her to check. There is no problem at all. However, after checking my bag, I asked her name as I did not see it on her uniform. Then she started to scream and she called security and the store manager to come. She keeps saying ""You are not allowed to ask my name"". We feel like we are a crime. Moreover, when she saw I was holding my phone in my hand, she thought I was taking her photo and she again screamed ""You are not allowed to take my picture"". After that, I explained everything to the store manager that her customer service was really bad and I already shown my phone to the security man and the store manager that I did not take any of her photos. She was so angry and aggressive just because I asked her name. This is so an awful experience us for when shopping at Woolies. The store manager then said sorry to us and she said her name is Joseline/Josephine. I used to work in Casuarina Square and I heard a lot of people complain about her. But this is the first time I have had this experience. I know I need to make this complaint about Josephine/Joseline.

google_maps,Nitmiluk Tours,"Easy to book tours online, confirmation emails are sent with clear directions and instructions on what to bring. This operation runs like clockwork, on time. We did two tours with comments down below for each: Half day Canoe Ferry ride down Gorge to disembark and walk a short way over rocks and steps/metal bridge to the canoes that were lined up ready to go from Gorge . Life jackets issued and instructions… then you are free to make your way up Gorge at your leisure. To enter Gorge , you have to drag the canoe over a few metres of rocks. This is quite difficult as the canoe is quite heavy and the rocks are very slippery and uneven. Gorge - there are a few places to pull up and chill -just avoid the signed crocodile nesting areas. There is plenty of time to do both gorges so take the time to swim and relax as we found we had to kill time - we didn’t need the amount of time allowed. There is cold drinking water back at base and squinchers (iykyk) before you head back on the ferry. Sunset Cruise We assumed we would be in the dinner boat the entire time for some reason, coasting up and down while we sipped our one included bubbly beverage. You depart on a ferry just like the canoe tour on gorge , (rows of seats) then at the beginning of gorge , you disembark on the opposite side to canoe and go on a short walk along which is a very smooth path with only a few steps (400m) to the next ferry that takes you along gorge . After viewing Gorge , you return and walk the return 400m to the dinner boat which has the tables set for dinner. The dinner seats are allocated so you will sit with whoever fits on your table of 4. The meal in general was very nice, we chose the steak for main and it was cooked to perfection - medium rare. The potato was undercooked and tasteless. You have to purchase any other alcoholic beverages. The only disappointment was that we didn’t cruise up and down but stayed in one spot and just went around in a circle and I think this was to create a breeze as it was very very hot and sweaty. Overall, we really enjoyed both our tours and would recommend them. Just be aware that the dinner cruise is pretty much the same tour as the day cruises and you only sit at the table on the way back. The sunset was underwhelming due to the clouds but that’s out of their control haha.

Multiple crocs got so close to the boat during their jump that they touched the boat. Its obvious that he has worked with these crocs for years, his passion, knowledge and experience shone through. He knew where to find every croc, how they preferred to catch their prey and how to read their body language. He knew all their little quirks and it meant we saw heaps of crocs. Despite being in a smaller boat, we never felt unsafe, at times he would stop trying to feed the crocs to gauge their behaviour, making sure that he didn't create competition for food between the crocs we got surrounded by. He also made sure that the weight of the boat was evenly distributed, which meant that the side of the boat not closest to the croc could stand up and get an amazing view. While this did mean sitting next to strangers, after 2 hours you all become mates anyway, this just speeds up the process. Our 2 hour tour ended up going over (which no one had any issues with) to make sure we got to see a large male croc up close. We learnt a-lot not just about the individual crocs on the river but also about crocs in general, their ecosystem on the river and their conservation story. We also got to see a Sea Eagle as well as multiple Black and Whistling Kites catch their food up close. I cannot recommend this tour more, if you are in Darwin and are toying up between tours, this is THE one to do. We have left the tour with amazing photos and videos, a deeper understanding of the Adelaide river and its crocs as well as a knowledge of croc safety and conservation.",5.0,2025-08-26T04:15:56+00:00,https://maps.google.com/?cid=7431301933792024370,Alexandra O'Neill,"{""place_id"": ""ChIJ8YcnxY6ruCwRMtdYbrxJIWc"", ""reviews_sort"": ""most_relevant""}",0,0,,,,google,1744,333,15,ChIJ8YcnxY6ruCwRMtdYbrxJIWc,2025-08-26 04:15:56,2025.0,8.0,1.0,13.0,1,0,5.0,pos,,

It is clear that Rex has such a passion and respect for these beautiful beasts and was extremely knowledgeable about each of the individual crocs, their behaviours, habitat, history and lifestyle. Rex went above and beyond to make our experience the most memorable moment of our trip. We loved every minute of our adventure with him and would highly recommend this tour to anyone, but more importantly to those who don’t want the cookie cutter touristy experience.
